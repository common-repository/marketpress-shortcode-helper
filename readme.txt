Tool that helps you generate MarketPress shortcodes from the page / post editor.

== Description ==

Marketpress is a great E-Commerce plugin, however, it can be frustrating having to go back and forth from the Store Settings > Shortcodes area to figure out which one you want to use and what attributes you can include. Now you no longer have to do that. This plugin will add a media icon to your posts and pages that allow you to easily generate MarketPress shortcodes. 

If you like the plugin and find it useful, please consider donating.

Thanks!
